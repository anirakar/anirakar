### Technical Manager at Capgemini | Java, Spring Boot & Microservices Expert | Experienced in Scalable & Maintainable Solutions

With over 12+ years of experience in software engineering, I currently serve as a Technical Manager at Capgemini India, where I specialize in building scalable, maintainable applications with a solid experience in Java, Spring Boot development and a good understanding of the Microservice framework, implementing DevOps practices, and utilizing observability tools (including logging, tracing, and monitoring) to ensure reliability and smooth system performance.

I have a strong track record in driving end-to-end development, optimizing APIs, applying best practices including clean code, test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). 

Iâ€™m passionate about leading technical teams and am now seeking opportunities to step into a technical architect role where I can design and guide complex systems while mentoring developers.
